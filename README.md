# SKTester
A simple testing program made in order to prepare myself better for some exams and learn a little about multithreading in C#.  
You cannot go back to previous questions. Currently the support is limited to a specific exam, but might expand it in the future.  
A file containing the questions is needed. The question txt file format is:

  
question  
-answer0  
-answer1  
-answer2  
-answer3  
x           
.  
.  
.  
question  
-answer0  
-answer1  
-answer2  
-answer3  
x  
END  
  

where x is the index od the correct answer  

Selecting answers:  0/1/2/3 key  
Next question:      ENTER

NOTE: there are some bugs currently that I do not really have time to fix
